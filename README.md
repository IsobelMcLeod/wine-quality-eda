# wine-quality-eda
Exploratory data analysis of a red wine quality dataset using R Studios, investigating relationships between physicochemical properties and wine quality. Coursework project.

## Overview
This project explores relationships between physicochemical properties of red wine
(e.g. alcohol content, sulphates, volatile acidity) and wine quality scores.
The analysis uses summary statistics and visualisations to identify key patterns
and associations within the data.

## Methods
- Data inspection and summary statistics
- Scatterplots to explore relationships between predictors and wine quality

## Tools
- R
- RStudio
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualisation
